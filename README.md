## About this project

### Summary
This service is analyzing Overwatch Gamers Statics daily and grade. Diplaying statics services were already existed. But I thought that type of services just displayed meaningless number. For example, User only can see number which is accumulated score. I think User wants to know what was today play, yesterday play and week play. And using comparing other user's statics, they want to know how themselves palyed.(In that time I used to play Overwatch). So, I decided to develop this project.
